 Predictive Pest Guard – AI-Driven Pest Outbreak Monitoring
 
Predictive Pest Guard is an AI-powered pest outbreak monitoring system that integrates machine learning, real-time weather data, and historical pest activity to predict and prevent agricultural pest infestations. The system is designed to assist farmers, researchers, and government agencies by providing early warnings and actionable insights to minimize crop damage and optimize pest control strategies.

🔍 Key Features
AI-Powered Pest Predictions – Uses TensorFlow-based models to analyze historical pest patterns and predict outbreaks.
Real-Time Weather Integration – Fetches live weather data via WeatherStack API to improve forecasting accuracy.
Interactive Dashboard – Displays weather data, pest risks, AI-generated assessments, alerts, and reports.
Global Pest Visualization – Interactive map for tracking pest outbreaks worldwide, with real-time updates.
User Authentication – Secure email/password and social login support via Firebase.
Multi-Database Support – Utilizes Firebase & MySQL for real-time and structured data storage.
Automated Alerts & Reports – Notifies users via SMS, email, and in-app alerts for high-risk pest outbreaks.
